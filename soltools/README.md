soltools
---

Go wrappers for 0x's suite of solidity tools.

This is used to get reports of Solidity code coverage from tests written in Go. This library provides an interface through which the Go tests can send Ethereum RPC requests through [sol-trace](https://sol-trace.com/) and then print a coverage report from [sol-coverage](https://sol-coverage.com/).
